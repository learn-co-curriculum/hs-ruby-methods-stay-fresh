<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTNX1c5UX-hAZrPPR5STGx5KIN6bJ9SMBuPABVoodQ_J5L4VPgQ">

Let's stay fresh on Ruby Methods. Here are a few challenges you can jump in to to practice defining methods:

+ Create a currency converter from Dollars to Japanese Yen (The exchange rate is currently 1 Dollar = 105 Yen).

+ Create a method that is given a name and prints the phrase "Good Morning" with the name.

+ Create a method that, when called, prompts the user for their favorite song. Return the song name followed by the phrase, that is my favorite song too!!!

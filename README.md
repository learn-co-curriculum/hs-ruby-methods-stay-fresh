Let's stay fresh on Ruby methods. Here are a few challenges you can jump into to practice defining methods:

1. Define a currency converter from Dollars to Japanese Yen (The exchange rate is currently 1 Dollar = 105 Yen).

2. Define a method that is given a name and prints the phrase "Good Morning" with the name.

3. Define a method that, when called, prompts the user for their favorite song. Return the song name followed by the phrase, that is my favorite song too!!!

4. Ve have Vays to make you talk: Define a method that replaces all w's in a given string to v's.

5. Define a method that takes a string and replaces each letter in the string with the next letter in the alphabet. So "ABC" becomce "BCD" and "Cat" becomes "Dbu". (This is a tough one!)
